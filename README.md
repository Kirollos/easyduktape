easyduktape
===========

A small library I've written to provide [duktape] (https://github.com/svaarala/duktape) in an easier way with C++ OOP methods.

This library is still under development and you may expect bugs/errors. If you spotted any issue make sure to file an issue on this repository!

Requirements
============

You only need duktape.c and duktape.h in your source files, and it will work!
